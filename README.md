# World_Weather_Analysis

For this project, I was tasked with creating a program that pulls 2,000 random cities, and those cities can be filtered by average temperatures. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. The program will also create a travel map between the four chosen cities.
